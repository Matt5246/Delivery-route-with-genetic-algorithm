# Delivery Route Optimization using Genetic Algorithm
Objective:
The task involves applying a genetic algorithm to optimize delivery routes for a courier company. The company has a set of customers labeled as K1, K2, ..., K10, each with specific locations and packages for delivery. The goal is to find an optimal route that minimizes the total cost or delivery time.

# Assumptions:

Assume that the courier company serves 10 customers identified as K1, K2, ..., K10. Each customer has an assigned location represented by geographic coordinates (e.g., latitude and longitude).
Define the cost or delivery time for each pair of customers. For instance, by using a cost matrix where the value in cell (i, j) represents the travel cost from customer i to customer j.
Instructions:

Input customer location data and create a cost matrix for routes between customers.
Apply a genetic algorithm that generates populations of routes, evaluates their fitness based on travel costs, and evolves towards an optimal route.
After the algorithm concludes, present the results, including the best route and its cost, along with a graphical visualization of the delivery route.
These assumptions and instructions aim to create a tool for efficiently optimizing delivery routes, contributing to the increased operational efficiency of the courier company.
